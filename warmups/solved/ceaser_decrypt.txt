Oh boy! Wow, this warmup challenge sure was a lot of fun to put togethe! I so
definitely absolutely always love trying to think up new and innovative things
to do with the very basic, common and classic CTF techniques! The first part of
your flag is flag{julius_ and that is a great start but it is not everything
that you will need to solve this challenge. I don't like trying to hide and

separate each part of the flag. The second part of the flag is _in_a_ but you do
need just a little bit more. What exactly should we include here to try and make
this filler text look more engaging and worthwhile? Should we add newlines?
Should we add spaces and try and make it symmetrical? How many lines is enough
to make this filler text look believable? A solid square of letters within a

end? It looks like it! I hope it is good. The third part of your flag is reflection}
